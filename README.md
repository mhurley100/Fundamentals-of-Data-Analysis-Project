# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - 2019 Project


## Introduction

This project interrogates the tips [6] dataset utilising Python [1], seaborn [5] and jupyter [4] packages. 
The goal of this project is to help the server maximise tips.  There are 2 distinct tasks:

- Demonstrate correlation between total bill and tip amount. 

- Determine if any of the categories provided (sex, smoker, time and day) influence tip rate.


### Project Plan

 - Descriptive Statistics
     - Research and understand the dataset
     - Review variables and establish if a correlation exists between the total bill and tip amount
          
 - Regression
     - Include variables in the regression model to demonstrate correlation between the total bill and tip amount
     
 - Analysis 
     - Analysis of the tipping patterns
     - Comparative Analysis

 - Conclusion
