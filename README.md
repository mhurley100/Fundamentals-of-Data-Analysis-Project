# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project

Introduction

This project concerns the tips [6] dataset utilising Python [1] packages, seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. 
Plan:
1.   Create and summarise the dataset with a well laid out and organised git repository, create a jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset. T
2.  Regression: To the jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a 
relationship between the total bill and tip amount.  In depth analysis of the relationship between total bill and
tip, with good explanations of the analysis.
3.  Using jupyter [4], analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset (you may analyse all pairs of variables or select a subset and analyse those). Reasonable investigation of  the relationship betweenthe variables, with interesting relationships highlighted
