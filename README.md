# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project

Introduction

This project concerns the tips [6] dataset utilising Python [1] packages, seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. 
Plan:
1.   Create and summarise the dataset with a well organised git repository and jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset.
    *   Review and observe the dataset.  Visually observe if any variables look interesting or warrant further review either now or further on in the project.
    * Import the dataset
    * Use Juypter to analyse using statistics where relevant.
2.  Regression: To the jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a 
relationship between the total bill and tip amount.  In depth analysis of the relationship between total bill and
tip, with good explanations of the analysis.
3.  Using jupyter [4], analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset (you may analyse all pairs of variables or select a subset and analyse those). Reasonable investigation of  the relationship betweenthe variables, with interesting relationships highlighted


Review and Observance of dataset:
Data appears clean.  Standard tip in the US is 15%.  Data from visual inspection of random lines appears to reflect the current trend.

244 instances.  8 variables of different types:
Floating point number:  Total Bill, Tip
Integer:    Party Size
Text:   Sex, Smoker, Day & Time

Import Dataset and libraries
Tips dataset is inbuit into seaboarn therefore it is more efficient to import.
