# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project

## Introduction

This project concerns the tips [6] dataset utilising Python [1] packages, seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. 

#### Project Plan:
1.   Create and summarise the dataset with a well organised git repository and jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset.
   1.2 Review and observe the dataset.  Visually observe if any variables look interesting or warrant further review either now or further on in the project.
    1.2  Import the dataset
    1.3  Use Pandas, Seaborn & Juypter to analyse using statistics where relevant.
    
2.  Regression: To the jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a 
relationship between the total bill and tip amount.  In depth analysis of the relationship between total bill and
tip, with good explanations of the analysis.

3.  Using jupyter [4], analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset (you may analyse all pairs of variables or select a subset and analyse those). Reasonable investigation of  the relationship betweenthe variables, with interesting relationships highlighted


### Review and Observance of dataset:
Data appears clean.  Standard tip in the US is 15%.  Data from visual inspection of random lines appears to reflect the current trend.

244 instances.  8 variables of different types:
Floating point number:  Total Bill, Tip
Integer:    Party Size
Text:   Sex, Smoker, Day & Time

### Import Dataset and libraries
Tips downloaded from https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv.

Used pandas describe() to summarise using statistics.  

Average bill i $19.68 average tip is $3 and average party size is 2.5.  Volume of customers is key therefore to higher tips as the bills are low.

Overall this shows that tip rate is representative of perception of 15%.  However we need to dig a bit deeper to investigate if there are any underlying trends.
